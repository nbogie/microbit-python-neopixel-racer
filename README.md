# microbit-python-neopixel-racer
micropython version of the bbc microbit neopixel racer system

## Installation:
* install race core, connect to neopixels - it may be necessary to install using Mu's "minify before flashing" micro:bit setting.
* install sample sfx and sample controller on two other microbits

## Issues:
* running out of memory with what i'd like to implement, even with Mu's "minify before flashing" micro:bit setting.
* max depth of around 8 nested calls: https://mail.python.org/pipermail/microbit/2016-February/000896.html
