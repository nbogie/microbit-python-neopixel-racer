# Adding sound and remote control to the micro:bit NeoPixelRacer!
## A PyCon UK 2018 Young Coders Day Workshop

Here are some resources from the PyCon UK 2018 Young Coders Day workshop called 
"Adding sound and remote control to the micro:bit NeoPixelRacer!"

## What's it about?

[Here's the original workshop description](https://2018.hq.pyconuk.org/schedule/item/E70D/):

"In this workshop we will add sound effects, music, and remote-controllers to an existing, exciting two-player neopixel light-racing game! 
We'll do this by using radio messaging between micro:bits, and we'll code this in MicroPython (It looks just like Python 3 code).

We'll make and customise the controllers ourselves.

If you're looking for cool project ideas for your micro:bit, you should definitely check this out!

Note: to get the most out of this workshop it is best if you've done a little bit of Python (or MicroPython) before. However, you do NOT need any experience with the micro:bit!

Note: We won't be programming the actual NeoPixels in this workshop, but we have made [the code for that part available](../src/) for anyone to reuse and learn from."
